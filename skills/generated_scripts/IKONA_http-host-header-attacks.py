The mismatch between proxy and app is the vulnerability.", "4. **Absolute URI overrides Host per RFC**: `GET http://evil.com/path HTTP/1.1\\nHost: target.com` \u2014 the spec says use the request-line URI. But not all implementations agree.", "5. **Cache poisoning via Host requires the cache to exclude Host from the key**: Most CDNs include Host in the cache key. But custom Varnish/Nginx caches may not. Also test with `X-Forwarded-Host` as cache key differentiator.", "6. **Connection-state attacks are rarely tested**: Automated scanners don't test keep-alive behavior. Manual testing via Burp Repeater's connection reuse is essential.", "7. **DNS rebinding + Host attacks**: If you control DNS, point your domain to the target's IP \u2192 your domain resolves to their server \u2192 Host header says your domain, but request hits their server.
