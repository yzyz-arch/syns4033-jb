Skill: the "finding"
Desc : Triage ASM/recon output for ownership before testing — separate the target's real assets from namespace-collision noise. Automated recon keyword-matches on the brand name, so for any target whose name is a common/dictionary word, the output is dominated by assets belonging to UNRELATED same-named companies (repos, cloud buckets, mobile apps, breach corpora, typosquats). Built from an authorized engagement where an ASM report's "Criticals" were overwhelmingly false positives and the combo/repos/mobile/bucket lists were polluted with unrelated same-named orgs. Use at the START of any engagement, immediately on receiving any ASM/recon/OSINT dataset, BEFORE testing anything.

Run:  python claude-bughunter-recon-scope-triage.py --help
